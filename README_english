# TelecomX — Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Context

TelecomX is a telecommunications company that has identified an **increase in service cancellations (churn)**.  
In response, a detailed analysis of its customer base was requested to **understand the drivers of churn and propose data-driven retention strategies**.

This project presents a **business-oriented Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** focused on identifying behavioral patterns, risk segments, and services associated with customer churn.

---

## Analysis Objectives

- Identify patterns between customers who churn and those who remain.
- Analyze demographic, contractual, and service-related variables.
- Detect factors that increase or reduce churn risk.
- Generate actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.

---

## Data Used

- Source: JSON file provided by the client  
- Total records processed: **7,267**
- Total valid customers analyzed: **7,043**
- Target variable: **Churn**

**Churn rate:**  
**26.54%**

---

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Main actions performed:

- Normalization of nested JSON structures into independent columns.
- Removal of non-analytical columns (`Customer ID`, `Total`).
- Validation of missing values (less than 5% of total).
- Segmentation of the dataset into active and churned customers.
- Correction of logical inconsistencies in contracted services.
- Transformation of categorical variables into numerical and dummy variables.
- Separation of categorical and numerical variables for focused analysis.

This process resulted in a consistent and reliable dataset.

## Methodology

1. Data ingestion from JSON  
2. Data cleaning and normalization  
3. Exploratory analysis by segments  
4. Continuous variable evaluation  
5. Contracted services analysis  
6. Correlation matrices and heatmaps  
7. Results interpretation and recommendations

## Analysis and Key Findings

### Demographic Segments

- Balanced gender distribution (≈50/50).
- 48.3% of customers have a partner.
- 29.96% have dependents.
- 16.21% are senior citizens (+65 years).

**Insight:**  
Customers who are **older, without a partner, and without dependents** show a higher churn risk.

---

### Continuous Variables

| Variable | Churn Mean | Non-Churn Mean | Churn Median | Non-Churn Median |
|--------|------------|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| Tenure (months) | 17.98 | 37.57 | 10.0 | 38.0 |
| Monthly Charges | 74.44 | 61.27 | 79.65 | 64.43 |

**Insight:**  
Churned customers:
- Have **shorter tenure** (≤10 months).
- Pay **higher monthly charges**.

➡ New customers + expensive plans = **high churn risk**.

---

### Contracted Services Analysis

**Services that reduce churn risk:**
- OnlineSecurity
- OnlineBackup
- DeviceProtection
- TechSupport

**Services associated with higher churn risk:**
- Fiber optic internet
- Streaming TV and Movies
- **Month-to-Month** contracts
- Paperless Billing
- **Electronic Check** payment method

**Insight:**  
Support services improve retention, while **expensive plans, flexible contracts, and electronic payment methods** increase churn risk.

---

## Relevant Correlations

**Highest positive correlation with churn:**
- Month-to-month contracts (0.40)
- Fiber internet (0.31)
- Electronic Check (0.30)
- Monthly Charges (0.19)

**Retention-related factors:**
- Tenure (-0.35)
- Two-year contracts (-0.30)
- OnlineSecurity (-0.17)
- TechSupport (-0.16)
- Partner / Dependents (-0.15)

**Technical insight:**  
There is no strong individual correlation between monthly cost and churn; cancellations are driven by a **combination of contractual and service-related factors**.

---

## Conclusions

1. Customers with **fiber optic + streaming services** do not perceive enough value relative to cost.
2. **Month-to-Month** contracts enable early cancellations.
3. Electronic payment methods, combined with high charges, increase churn.
4. Retention improves with:
   - Longer tenure
   - Long-term contracts
   - Support services
   - Customers with partners or dependents

---

## Business Recommendations

- Focus retention campaigns on **new customers, senior citizens, and customers without dependents**.
- Encourage the adoption of **support services**.
- Promote longer-term contracts.
- Review pricing and bundles for fiber optic and streaming services.
- Reevaluate the electronic payment experience for high-value customers.
